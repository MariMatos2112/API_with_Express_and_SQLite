# NodeJS API with Express and SQLite
## What this API does
It allows to save some data from songs into the SQLite database present on the project. You can also search for the song you've inserted (using its name, its singer, its name and singer, or even all songs at once). Deleting a particular song is also possible by using its unique ID.

## Motivation 
I was doing a NodeJS course in Alura platform and I got excited about what I was learning. That's when I decided that I was going to open my heart and develop a different and more complete API. It's still a pretty simple project but it was pretty good for me to have a taste of how NodeJs works and what I could do with it. 

## Tecnologies that I used
- JavaScript (NodeJS)
- SQlite

## Tools 
- Postman to make the requests
<b>Obs:</b> You can also use "curl" if you prefer.
